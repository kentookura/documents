We develop the basic geometry behind the \'etale topos of a scheme. First we develop the notion of \'etale morphism and show how they behave like local homeomorphisms. We then apply this theory to construct the \'etale fundamental group of a scheme. Finally we consider sheaves on the \'etale site of a scheme and show how the category of sheaves on a scheme admits an internal logic.

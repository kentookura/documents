\section{Galois cohomology}
The simplest case of \'etale cohomology is the case of fields. In this case, \'etale cohomology is equivalent to Galois cohomology.
Let $M$ be a $G$ module for $G$ a finite group, meaning that $M$ is an abelian group with a left $G$-action. We will later also consider profinite groups because we are interested in the case of absolute Galois groups. A $G$-module homomorphism is a $G$-equivariant homomorphism. Denote by $M^G = \{m \in M \mid gm = g, \ \forall g \in G\}$ the submodule of $G$-fixed points.
\begin{example}
	Let $G = \Gal(L/k)$. We have the following examples:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item By Galois theory the fixed field of $L$ under $G$ is exactly $L^G = k$
		\item $\mathcal{O}_L^G = \mathcal{O}_k$.
		\item $\mu_n(L)^G = \mu_n(k)$
	\end{itemize}
\end{example}

Let $P, M$, and $N$ be $G$-modules fitting into an exact sequence
\[
	0 \to P \xrightarrow{\alpha} M \xrightarrow{\beta} N \to 0
\]
and let
\[
	P^G \xrightarrow{\alpha'} M^G \xrightarrow{\beta'} N^G
\]
be the resulting sequence. The map $\alpha'$ is just the restriction of an injective map, so $\alpha$ is injective.
Note:
$\ker(\beta') = \ker \beta \cap M^G$

We will show that $im(\alpha') = im(\alpha) \cap M^G$.
Note that $im(\alpha') \subset im(\alpha) \cap M^G$.
For the other inclusion let $m \in im(\alpha) \cap m^G$. There exists a $p \in P$ such that $\alpha(p)=m$. Now let $\sigma \in G,\ \sigma(\alpha(p)) = \sigma(m) = m$,
Since $\alpha(\sigma(p)) = \alpha(p) = m$ and $\alpha$ is injective, $p = \sigma(p)$ so $p$ is fixed under the $G$-action. $im(\alpha) = \ker(\beta) \implies im(\alpha) \cap M^G = \ker(\beta) \cap M^G$.
However, the functor is not right exact:
\begin{example}
	\[1 \to \{\pm 1\} \to \C^\times \to \C^\times \to 1\]
	is exact but
	\[1 \to\{\pm 1\} \to \R^\times \xrightarrow{x \mapsto x^2} \R^\times\]
	is not surjective on the right.
\end{example}

We have shown that the functor $M \to M^G$ is left exact.

\[H^1(\Gal(k),M) \cong H_\text{\et}^1(\Spec(k), \widetilde{M})\]

\begin{definition}
	Let $M$ be a $G$-module. The group of $1$-cochains from $G$ to $M$ is defined to be  $C^1(G, M) = \{\varphi: G \to M\}$

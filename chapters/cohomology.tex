\section{Motivation for Cohomology}
One of the most important invariants of schemes is \'etale cohomology.  Cohomology is an important invariant in geometry and topology which associates to each space $X$ a sequence of abelian groups $H^i(X)$, $i \ge 0$, the cohomology groups of $X$. For each map $f: X \to Y$ of spaces there are homomorphisms $f^*: H^i(Y) \to H^i(X)$. Moreover there are so called coboundary morphisms $\partial^i : H^i \to H^{i+1}$ for each $i \ge 0$.

We can deduce many interesting properties of spaces from their cohomology groups and the associated homomorphisms.

An important and intuitive cohomology is \textit{singular cohomology}. It provides a rigorous way for counting ``holes'' in a topological space. For instance, the circle $S^1$ has 1 one-dimensional hole while the torus $T^2$ has 2. The sphere $S^2$ has 1 two-dimensional hole but no one-dimensional holes, in symbols\footnote{$\Z$ appears here because it is the free group on one generator.}
\begin{align*}
	H^1_{sing}(S^1) \simeq \Z,\quad & H^1_{sing}(T^2) \simeq \Z \oplus \Z, \\
	H^1_{sing}(S^2) \simeq  0,\quad & H^2_{sing}(S^2) \simeq \Z.
\end{align*}
A general approach to cohomology is to use sheaves on a topological space as ``coefficients''. Sheaves consist of local data on a space that is glueable. A basic example consists of functions on a space: If we have an open cover $\{ U_i\}$ for a manifold $M$ and functions $f_i: M \to \R$ that agree on all intersections $U_i \cap U_j$ we may patch it together to a function $f: M \to \R$.
For any space $X$ and any sheaf $\Sh{F}$ on $X$ we can define $H^i(X, \Sh{F})$. Many examples of cohomology theories turn out to stem from the cohomology of a particular sheaf. For example, if $X$ is a locally contractible space, the singular cohomology $H_{\text{sing}}^i(X)$ of $X$ is isomorphic to the sheaf cohomology $H^i(X, \Z_X)$ of the constant sheaf $\Z_X$ on $X$.

One of the main motivations for \'etale cohomology is that one would like a replacment for singular cohomology for schemes. There are a number of obstacles:
\begin{proposition}\label{scheme_contractible}
	An irreducible scheme is contractible.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Define a map $f: X \times I \to X$  by $f(x,0) = x$ and $f(x,t) = \eta$ for $t > 0$. This is a contraction of $X$ onto the point $\eta$, so the singular cohomology of $X$ is identically 0.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	$H^i(X, \Sh{F})$ is 0 for any sheaf on an irreducible topological space.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	See section TODO.
\end{proof}
This is a strong indication that the traditional tools of cohomology are inadequate to analyse the geometry of schemes.

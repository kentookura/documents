\begin{theorem}
	Let $G$ be a topological group. Then the category of $G$-sets is equivalent to the topos of sheaves on the atomic site, whose objects are open subgroups of $G$ and morphisms $H \to K$ are the left cosets $aK$ such that $H \subseteq aKa^{-1}$.\\
	For a proof and definitions, see \cite{SIGL}, Chapter 3.9
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
	If $B$ is integral over $A$ and $P \subset A$ is a prime ideal, then there exists a prime ideal $Q$ in $B$ such that $Q \cap A = P$. Furthermore, $P$ is maximal in $A$ if and only if $Q$ is maximal in $B$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{construction}
	Let $\varphi \colon X \to S$ be an surjective morphism of affine schemes, say $X = \Spec(A), S = \Spec(B)$, and let $\varphi^*$ be the corresponding ring homomorphism. Let $G \subset \Aut(X/S)$ be a finite subgroup of automorphisms over $S$. Then the underlying space of $X_G \coloneqq \Spec(B^G)$ is homeomorphic to the quotient of $X$ by the action of $G$:j
\end{construction}

\begin{proof}
	We first construct a map from the underlying space of $X_G$
\end{proof}

\section{The \'etale topology}
The natural topology one has available in algebraic geometry is the Zariski topology. For some purposes this topology is insufficient. In particular, by a theorem of Grothendieck, higher cohomology for constant sheaves vanishes, so we can not use sheaf cohomology to define Betti numbers. The reason is that the open sets of the Zariski topology are very large. However, instead of considering Zariski-open sets, one may use the notion of \'etale open sets. These are not really open sets of a topological space, but formally share many properties of open sets. In particular, they have all the properties one needs to define sheaves and their cohomology. This, in turn, yields satisfactory analogues from algebraic topology. 

\section{prerequisites}
We assume aqcuaintance with the basics of category theory including limits and adjoint functors. We will make free use of results from algebra but will provide references wherever needed. We will also use basic notions of scheme theory.

%\section{WIP}
%Another central notion of modern geometry is that one thinks of spaces as being “glued together” from simple building blocks. A manifold is locally modelled on $\mathbb{R}^n$. A simplicial complex and more generally simplicial sets and simplicial objects are geometric objects that are modeled on the standard simplices $\Delta^n$, depicted below for $n = 1,2,3$.

%Because a manifold $X$ is locally modelled on euclidian space, it comes equipped with a so-called sheaf of of rings $\Sh{O}_X$, which is inherited from the ring structure on $\R$. In particular there is the ring of \textit{global} sections
%\[\{f: X \to \R \} \coloneqq  \Gamma(\Sh{O}, X).\]
%Can we interpret an arbitrary commutative ring as a ring of functions on a geometric object?
%Alexander Grothendieck's definition of schemes provide an answer: For any ring $R$ there is a locally ringed space $(X, \Sh{O}_X) = (\Spec(R), \Sh{O}_{\Spec(R)})$ such that $\Gamma(X, \Sh{O}_X) \cong R$

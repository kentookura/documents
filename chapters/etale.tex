There are many reasons why \'etale morphisms are important in algebraic geometry. They allow us to formulate covering space theory for schemes as they behave like local homeomorphisms. They also behave like generalised open sets, so we can consider sheaves on a sort of generalised topology on $X$ containing not only open subsets $U \subseteq X$ but more generally morphisms of schemes $Y \to X$. This is the \textit{\'etale site of $X$}, denoted by $\Et/X$, a category whose objects are schemes $Y$ equipped with an \'etale morphism $\varphi \colon Y \to X$ and whose morphisms are $f$ \'etale morphisms over $X$. We declare a covering of an \'etale open $U$ in $\Et/X$ to be a jointly surjective family of \'etale maps: $\{f_i \colon U_i \to U\}$ with $\bigcup_i f(U_i) = U$. We will show that under mild hypotheses, an affine surjective morphism $\varphi \colon X \to S$ is \'etale if and only if there is a finite locally free and surjective morhpism $\psi \colon Y \to S$ such that $X \times_S Y \simeq \coprod_i Y$ is a trivial cover of $Y$, so only if it is locally trivial in this more general sense. A category equivalent to the category of sheaves on a site is called a Grothendieck topos. In the next chapter we will define the \'Etale topos $\sh_{\Et}(X)$ of $X$ which is the category of sheaves on $\Et/X$. The \'Etale topos $\mathsf{Sh}_{\Et}(X)$ of $X$ may be thought of as a generalised space, locally modeled on $X$, with a close relation to the geometric properties of $X$. Furthermore, there is a way to construct a semantics of intuitionistic higher order logic inside of any Grothendieck topos (or more generally inside of any elementary topos, which is a more general notion) where the \'etale opens $U \to X$ are the objects for which the \textit{forcing relation} $U \Vdash \varphi(x)$ is defined, where we interpret this to mean that $\varphi$ holds locally on $U$.

There are two reasons why \'etale morphisms are important in algebraic geometry. They allow us to formulate covering space theory for schemes as they behave like local homeomorphisms. They also behave like generalised open sets, so we can consider sheaves on a sort of generalised topology on $X$ containing not only open subsets $U \subseteq X$ but more generally morphisms of schemes $Y \to X$. We will define the \textit{\'etale site of $X$}, denoted by $\Et/X$, a category whose objects are schemes $Y$ equipped with an \'etale morphism $\varphi \colon Y \to X$ and whose morphisms are morphisms over $X$. We declare a covering of an \'etale open $U$ in $\Et/X$ to be a jointly surjective family of \'etale maps: $\{f_i \colon U_i \to U\}$ with $\bigcup_i f(U_i) = U$. We will show that under mild hypotheses, an affine surjective morphism $\varphi \colon X \to S$ is \'etale if and only if there is a finite locally free and surjective morhpism $\psi \colon Y \to S$ such that $X \times_S Y \simeq \coprod_i Y$ is a trivial cover of $Y$, so only if it is locally trivial in this more general sense. A category equivalent to the category of sheaves on a site is called a Grothendieck topos. In the next chapter we will define the \'etale topos $\sh_{\et}(X)$ of $X$ which is the category of sheaves on $\Et/X$. The \'etale topos $\sh_{\et}(X)$ of $X$ may be thought of as a generalised space, locally modeled on $X$, with a close relation to the geometric properties of $X$.

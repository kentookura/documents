The issues we encountered in the introduction all stem from the fact that the Zariski topology is too coarse to speak of ``local triviality''. Grothendieck found a natural generalisation of the notion of topology, allowing not only open subsets $U \subseteq X$ but more generally morphisms of schemes $Y \to X$ to play the role of open set. Specifically, he defined the \textit{\'etale site of $X$}, denoted by $\Et/X$, a category whose objects are schemes $Y$ equipped with an \'etale morphism $\varphi \colon Y \to X$ and whose morphisms are $f$ \'etale morphisms over $X$. We will later define sheaves on the \'etale site in much the same way as we do on topological spaces, where we declare a covering of an \'etale open $U$ in $\Et/X$ to be a jointly surjective family of \'etale maps: $\{f_i \colon U_i \to U\}$ with $\bigcup_i f(U_i) = U$. We will show that under mild hypotheses, an affine surjective morphism $\varphi \colon X \to S$ is \'etale if and only if there is a finite locally free and surjective morhpism $\psi \colon Y \to S$ such that $X \times_S Y \simeq \coprod_i Y$ is a trivial cover of $Y$, so only if it is locally trivial in this more general sense. A category equivalent to the category of sheaves on a site is called a Grothendieck topos. In the next chapter we will define the \'Etale topos $\sh_{\Et}(X)$ of $X$ which is the category of sheaves on $\Et/X$. The \'etale topos $\mathsf{Sh}_{\et}(X)$ of $X$ may be thought of as a generalised space, locally modeled on $X$, with a close relation to the geometric properties of $X$. Furthermore, there is a way to construct a semantics of intuitionistic higher order logic inside of any Grothendieck topos (or more generally inside of any elementary topos, which is a more general notion) where the \'etale opens $U \to X$ are the objects for which the \textit{forcing relation} $U \Vdash \varphi(x)$ is defined, where we interpret this to mean that $\varphi$ holds locally on $U$.

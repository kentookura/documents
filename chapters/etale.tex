\section{\'Etale Cohomology}
The \'etale cohomology of a scheme was defined by Alexandre Grothendieck, Michael Artin and Jean-Luis Verdier in the late 50's. Andr\'e Weil had conjectured the existence of a cohomology theory for varieties over finite fields, from which his famous Weil conjectures could be deduced.
Their goal was to find a cohomology theory that is suited for arithmetic applications.

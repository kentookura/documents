\subsection{\'Etale Algebras}
We begin our discussion with the simple case of \'etale covers of $X = \Spec(k)$, where $k$ is a field. In order to model the notion of local homeomorphism, it is reasonable to demand that for $f: Y \to X$ to be a local homeomorphism,  the underlying topological space of $Y$ should consist of a finite number of disjoint points. If we restrict our attention to the case that $Y$ is affine, it follows that $Y = \Spec(\prod L_i)$ where each $L_i$ is a field extension of $k$. 

\begin{definition}[finite \'etale algebras]
  A finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$ is \'etale over $k$ if it is isomorphic to a product of separable extensions of $k$. We define $\Spec(A) \to \Spec(k)$ to be \'etale if $A$ is an \'etale algebra over $k$.
\end{definition}

Recall that an extension $L/k$ is separable if its minimal polynomial $p(x)$ has no multiple roots (in a splitting field of $p(x)$). It follows from basic algebra that a polynomial $p(x)$ is separable if and only if it is coprime to its formal derivative $p'(x)$. This menas that $p'(x)$ gets mapped to a unit under the canonical map $k[x] \to k[x]/(p(x)) \simeq L$. This is in effect a smoothness condition, reminiscent of the conditions under which the inverse mapping theorem from analysis holds. This idea will reappear when we define \'etale morphisms in a more general condition.

We require separability of the extensions because of their good categorical properties. Grothendieck's reformulation of Galois theory is in fact a statement about finite \'etale algebras and establishes a strong analogy with the theory of covering spaces and of fundamental groups. This connection allows us to define the fundamental group of a scheme. We refer to~\cite{Szamuely} for more details.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$ be a finite dimensional commutative $k$-algebra and denote by $\overline{A}$ the $\overline{k}$-algebra $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$. The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ is \'etale over $k$.\label{etale}
    \item $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$ is isomorphic to a finite product of copies of $\overline{k}$, hence \'etale over $\overline{k}$.\label{product}
    \item The discriminant of any basis of $A$ over $k$ is nonzero.\label{trace}
    %The trace pairing $A \times A \to k, (x,y) \to \text{Tr}(xy)$ is nondegenerate.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $L$ is a finite separable extension of $k$. This means that $L = k[x]/(f)$, where $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ which splits into $n$ distinct factors, say $(x-\alpha_i)$ in $\overline{k}$. By the chinese remainder theorem we have
  \[L \otimes_k \overline{k} \cong \overline{k}[x]/(f) = \overline{k}[x]/(x-\alpha_1)\cdots(x-\alpha_n) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n \overline{k}[x] / (x-\alpha_i) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n \overline{k},\] from which the first direction follows.
  \Implies{etale}{trace} If $A = \prod k_i$  where each $k_i$ is a separable field extension of $k$, then $\text{disc}(A) = \prod \text{disc}(k_i)$ which is nonzero by the fact that $\text{disc}(k_i) \neq 0$ if $k_i$ is a separable extension.
  %TODO finish the proof
\end{proof}
We generalise this definition to an algebra over a ring. Let $R$ be a ring, $A$ an $R$-algebra that is free and of finite rank. The map $m_a: A \to A$ defined by left multiplication $x \to ax$ is $R$-linear, so we may consider its trace. Define an bilinear map $\varphi: B \times B \to A$ by $\varphi(x,y) = \text{Tr}(xy)$. We define $A$ to be separable over $R$ if $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. It turns out that this definition agrees with the previous one in the case that $R$ is a field.

\subsection{\'Etale morphisms of schemes}
\begin{definition}
A morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ is called \textit{affine} if there is an open affine cover by subsets $U_i$ such that $f^{-1}(U_i)$ is affine for each $i$.  A morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ is called \textit{finite} if there is an affine cover by subsets $U_i = \Spec(A)$ such that $f^{-1}(U_i) = \Spec(B_i)$ is a finitely generated $A_i$-module.  If moreover each $B_i$ is a fee separable $A_i$-algebra, it is said to be \'etale.
%We say that $f: X \to S$ is finite locally free if $f$ is affine and $f_* \Sh{O}_X$ is locally free and of finite rank.
%If each fibre $X_p$ of $f$ is the spectrum of a finite \'etale $\kappa(p)$-algebra, then we say $f$ is an \'etale morphism.
\end{definition}
It follows that $f: \Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ is an \'etale morphism if and only if $B$ is an \'etale $A$-algebra.

\subsection{Galois theory for \'etale covers}
\begin{definition}[The fiber functor $F_x$]
  
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Galois covers]
  A connected finite \'etale cover $Y \to X$ is \textit{Galois} if its group of $X$-automorphism acts transitively on geometric fibers.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The composition of affine morphisms is affine.
    \item The composition of finite locally free morphisms is finite locally free.
    \item The composition of \'etale morphisms is \'etale.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first statement follows immediately from the fact that a morphism $f: X \to Y$ is affine if and only if for \textit{every} affine open $V \subseteq X$, $f^{-1}(V)$ is affine, see\cite{Hartshorne}.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
  If $f: Y \to X$ is \'etale, then the base change $U \times_X Y$ along any morphism $U \to X$ is \'etale.
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}
  A surjective finite \'etale morphism is called an \'etale cover. An \'etale cover $\varphi : Y \to X$ is claled trivial if $Y$ is isomorphic do a finite disjoint union of copies of $X$ $Y \cong \coprod X$ and $\varphi$ restricts to the identity on each component.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} 
  \label{locallyTrivial}
  Let $X$ be a connected scheme and $\varphi : Y \to X$ an affine surjective morphism. Then $\varphi$ is finite \'etale if and only if there is a finite, locally free and surjective morphism $f: S \to X$ such that $Y \times_X S$ is a trivial cover of $S$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  For the ``if'' part, we first show that $\varphi$ is finite and locally free. Since $f$ is locally free, each point of $X$ has an affine open neighborhood $U = \Spec(R)$ such that $f$ restricts to a morphism $\Spec(A) \to \Spec(R)$ where $A$ is a finitely generated and free $R$-module. Since $\varphi$ is affine, it restricts to $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(R)$ over $U$ and the basechange $S \times_X Y$ restricts to $\Spec(A \otimes_R B)$ over $\Spec(R)$. By assumption $A \otimes_R B$ is a finitely generated and free $A$-module, so it is also fnitely generated and free as an $R$-module. It is also isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of $A$. This can only happen if $B$ is finitely generated and free over $R$.

    \]
  Now let $\overline{x} : \Spec(\overline{k}) \to S$ be a geometric point of $S$. By composition with $f$ we get a geometric point of $X$. Now the geometric fibers $Y_{(f \circ \overline{x})}$ and $(S \times_X Y)_{\overline{x}}$  are isomorphic by the universal property of pullbacks.

\]
By assumption, $(S\times_X Y)_{\overline{x}} \cong \prod \Spec(\overline{k})$ and since $f$ is surjective, all of the fibers of $\varphi$ are also \'etale.
\end{proof}
Theorem \ref{locallyTrivial} shows that \'etale morphsism are locally trivial in the \'etale topology.
The previous results allow us to consider the \textit{\'etale site} of a scheme $X$. It has as objects \'etale morphisms $f: S \to X$ and as morphisms commutative triangles

 such that $f = f' \circ \varphi$. 


\begin{remark}
  If we have an \'etale cover $f: Y \to X$ and consider a geometric point $\overline{x} : \Spec(\Omega) \to X$ of $X$, then the fiber of $f$ over $\overline{x}$ arises from the pullback

  Since $\Spec(\Omega)\times_X Y$ is \'etale over $\Spec(\Omega)$ and $\Omega$ is algebraically closed, it follows that $\Spec(\Omega)\times_X Y \cong \coprod \Spec(\Omega)$
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Recall that a category $\mathcal{C}$ is \textit{cofiltered} if the following holds:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For any pair of objects $a_1$ and $a_2$, there is an object $b$ with maps $b \to a_1$ and $b \to a_2$.
    \item Every pair of morphisms $f,g: a \to b$, there is an equalizer $h: c \to a$. This means that $f \circ h = g \circ h$.
  \end{enumerate} 
  Let $x$ be a point of $X$. The subcategory of $\Op(X)$ consisting of all sets containing $x$ is cofilterd. This means for two open sets $U$ and $V$, there is an open set contained in both of them, namely $U \cap V$. The second condition does not need to be verified, since there is at most one morphism between any two open sets.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
  A presheaf $\Sh{F}$ on $\text{\'Et}/X$ is a sheaf if and only if $\Sh{F}$ satisfies the sheaf condition for Zariski open coverings and for \'etale coverings consisting of a single map $V \to U$, where $V$ and $U$ are affine.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \cite{milneLEC}.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  Every presheaf represented by an $X$-scheme $U \to \Hom_X(U,Z)$ is a sheaf. 
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  It is obviously a sheaf for the Zariski topology. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[\'Etale neighborhoods]
  Let $X$ be a scheme and $x$ a point of $X$. An \'etale neighborhood of $x$ is defined to be a pair $(U, u)$ together with an \'etale morphism $\varphi: U \to X$ such that $\varphi(u) = x$. A morphism of \'etale neighborhoods $f: (V,v) \to (U,u)$ is a morphism of $X$-schemes $f: V \to U$ such that $f(v) = u$.
\end{definition}
We obtain the category of \'etale neigborhoods of $x$ for each $x \in X$.

\begin{definition}[Affine maps of schemes]
  Let $\varphi: X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes over a field $k$. We say $\varphi$ is an affine map if every open affine subscheme $U = \Spec(R) \subseteq Y$ has as preimage an affine open subscheme $f^{-1}(U) = \Spec(S)$ of $X$. If, in addition, the corresponding map $R \to S$ makes $S$ into a finitely generated $R$-module, we say that $\varphi$ is finite.
\end{definition}

  Consider first the case that $X$ is connected. It follows that $X = \Spec(A)$ and that $A$ is a vector space of finite dimension over $k$. If $A$ is not a field then it has a

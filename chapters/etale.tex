The issues we encountered in the introduction all stem from the fact that the Zariski topology is very coarse. Grothendieck found a natural generalisation of the notion of topology, allowing not only open subsets $U \subseteq X$ but more generally morphisms of schemes $Y \to X$ to play the role of open set. Specifically, he defined the \textit{\'etale site of $X$}, a generalised topology on $X$, consisting of the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The category of \'etale schemes $\text{\'Et}/X$ over $X$. This category consists of schemes $S$ together with an \'etale morphism $f: S \to X$. These morphisms formally behave like local homeomorphisms. 
  \item A notion of covering. In this case a covering of $X$ is a family of \'etale morphisms $\{\varphi_i: U_i \to X\}$ such that they are jointly surjective, $\bigcup_i im(\varphi_i) = X$. We will make this more precise later.
\end{itemize}
It will turn out that surjective \'etale maps give us the right notion for covering space theory for schemes. In particular they will allow us to define fundamental groups. Furthermore, the \'etale site will fix the issues we had in defining cohomology as well.

The \'etale topos $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$ of a scheme $X$ is the category of sheaves on the \'etale site of $X$.  The \'etale topos $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$ may be thought of as a generalised space, locally modeled on $X$, with a close relation to the geometric properties of $X$. 

Because \'etale morphisms behave like local homeomorphisms, it is possible to realise the theory of covering spaces for schemes. In particular this means that we get a good notion the fundamental groups $\pi_1(X)$. Furthermore, the \'etale topos $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$ also allows us to compute cohomology for sheaves which have vanishing cohomology in the Zariski setting. In this sense the \'etale site of a scheme is a much finer topology than the Zariski topology.

\subsection{\'Etale Algebras}
We begin our discussion with the simple case of \'etale covers of $X = \Spec(k)$, where $k$ is a field. In order to model the notion of local homeomorphism, it is reasonable to demand that for $f: Y \to \Spec(k)$ to be a local homeomorphism,  the underlying topological space of $Y$ should consist of a finite number of disjoint points. If we restrict our attention to the case that $Y$ is affine, it follows that $Y = \Spec(\prod L_i)$ where each $L_i$ is a field extension of $k$. 

\begin{definition}[finite \'etale algebras]
  A finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$ is \'etale over $k$ if it is isomorphic to a product of separable extensions of $k$. We define $\Spec(A) \to \Spec(k)$ to be \'etale if $A$ is an \'etale algebra over $k$.
\end{definition}

Recall that an extension $L/k$ is separable if its minimal polynomial $p(x)$ has no multiple roots (in a splitting field of $p(x)$). It follows from basic algebra that a polynomial $p(x)$ is separable if and only if it is coprime to its formal derivative $p'(x)$. This menas that $p'(x)$ gets mapped to a unit under the canonical map $k[x] \to k[x]/(p(x)) \simeq L$. This is in effect a smoothness condition, reminiscent of the conditions under which the inverse mapping theorem from analysis holds. This idea will reappear when we define \'etale morphisms in a more general condition.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$ be a finite dimensional commutative $k$-algebra and denote by $\overline{A}$ the $\overline{k}$-algebra $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$. The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ is \'etale over $k$.\label{etale}
    \item $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$ is isomorphic to a finite product of copies of $\overline{k}$, hence \'etale over $\overline{k}$.\label{product}
    \item The discriminant of any basis of $A$ over $k$ is nonzero.\label{trace}
    %The trace pairing $A \times A \to k, (x,y) \to \text{Tr}(xy)$ is nondegenerate.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $L$ is a finite separable extension of $k$. This means that $L = k[x]/(f)$, where $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ which splits into $n$ distinct factors, say $(x-\alpha_i)$ in $\overline{k}$. By the chinese remainder theorem we have
  \[L \otimes_k \overline{k} \cong \overline{k}[x]/(f) = \overline{k}[x]/(x-\alpha_1)\cdots(x-\alpha_n) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n \overline{k}[x] / (x-\alpha_i) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n \overline{k},\] from which the first direction follows.
  \Implies{etale}{trace} If $A = \prod k_i$  where each $k_i$ is a separable field extension of $k$, then $\text{disc}(A) = \prod \text{disc}(k_i)$ which is nonzero by the fact that $\text{disc}(k_i) \neq 0$ if $k_i$ is a separable extension.
  %TODO finish the proof
\end{proof}
We generalise this definition to an algebra over a ring. Let $R$ be a ring, $A$ an $R$-algebra that is free and of finite rank. The map $m_a: A \to A$ defined by left multiplication $x \to ax$ is $R$-linear, so we may consider its trace. Define an bilinear map $\varphi: B \times B \to A$ by $\varphi(x,y) = \text{Tr}(xy)$. We define $A$ to be separable over $R$ if $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. It turns out that this definition agrees with the previous one in the case that $R$ is a field.

\subsection{\'Etale morphisms of schemes}
\begin{definition}
A morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ is called \textit{affine} if there is an open affine cover by subsets $U_i$ such that $f^{-1}(U_i)$ is affine for each $i$.  A morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ is called \textit{finite} if there is an affine cover by subsets $U_i = \Spec(A)$ such that $f^{-1}(U_i) = \Spec(B_i)$ is a finitely generated $A_i$-module.  If moreover each $B_i$ is a fee separable $A_i$-algebra, it is said to be \'etale.
%We say that $f: X \to S$ is finite locally free if $f$ is affine and $f_* \Sh{O}_X$ is locally free and of finite rank.
%If each fibre $X_p$ of $f$ is the spectrum of a finite \'etale $\kappa(p)$-algebra, then we say $f$ is an \'etale morphism.
\end{definition}
It follows that $f: \Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ is an \'etale morphism if and only if $B$ is an \'etale $A$-algebra.

\begin{lemma}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The composition of affine morphisms is affine.
    \item The composition of finite locally free morphisms is finite locally free.
    \item The composition of \'etale morphisms is \'etale.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first statement follows immediately from the fact that a morphism $f: X \to Y$ is affine if and only if for \textit{every} affine open $V \subseteq X$, $f^{-1}(V)$ is affine, see\cite{Hartshorne}.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
  If $f: Y \to X$ is \'etale, then the base change $U \times_X Y$ along any morphism $U \to X$ is \'etale.
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}
  A surjective finite \'etale morphism is called an \'etale cover. An \'etale cover $\varphi : Y \to X$ is claled trivial if $Y$ is isomorphic do a finite disjoint union of copies of $X$ $Y \cong \coprod X$ and $\varphi$ restricts to the identity on each component.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} 
  \label{locallyTrivial}
  Let $X$ be a connected scheme and $\varphi : Y \to X$ an affine surjective morphism. Then $\varphi$ is finite \'etale if and only if there is a finite, locally free and surjective morphism $f: S \to X$ such that $Y \times_X S$ is a trivial cover of $S$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  For the ``if'' part, we first show that $\varphi$ is finite and locally free. Since $f$ is locally free, each point of $X$ has an affine open neighborhood $U = \Spec(R)$ such that $f$ restricts to a morphism $\Spec(A) \to \Spec(R)$ where $A$ is a finitely generated and free $R$-module. Since $\varphi$ is affine, it restricts to $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(R)$ over $U$ and the basechange $S \times_X Y$ restricts to $\Spec(A \otimes_R B)$ over $\Spec(R)$. By assumption $A \otimes_R B$ is a finitely generated and free $A$-module, so it is also fnitely generated and free as an $R$-module. It is also isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of $A$. This can only happen if $B$ is finitely generated and free over $R$.

  Now let $\overline{x} : \Spec(\overline{k}) \to S$ be a geometric point of $S$. By composition with $f$ we get a geometric point of $X$. Now the geometric fibers $Y_{(f \circ \overline{x})}$ and $(S \times_X Y)_{\overline{x}}$  are isomorphic by the universal property of pullbacks.

\]
By assumption, $(S\times_X Y)_{\overline{x}} \cong \prod \Spec(\overline{k})$ and since $f$ is surjective, all of the fibers of $\varphi$ are also \'etale.
\end{proof}
Theorem \ref{locallyTrivial} shows that \'etale morphsism are locally trivial in the \'etale topology.
The previous results allow us to consider the \textit{\'etale site} of a scheme $X$. It has as objects \'etale morphisms $f: S \to X$ and as morphisms commutative triangles

\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
  If we have an \'etale cover $f: Y \to X$ and consider a geometric point $\overline{x} : \Spec(\Omega) \to X$ of $X$, then the fiber of $f$ over $\overline{x}$ arises from the pullback

  Since $\Spec(\Omega)\times_X Y$ is \'etale over $\Spec(\Omega)$ and $\Omega$ is algebraically closed, it follows that $\Spec(\Omega)\times_X Y \cong \coprod \Spec(\Omega)$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Galois theory for \'etale covers}
\begin{definition}[The fiber functor $F_x$]
  Let $x: \Spec(\Omega) \to X$ be a geometric point, where $\Omega$ is an algebraically field. The fiber functor at $x$ associates to each \'etale cover $f: Y \to X$ the underlying set of $\Spec(\Omega) \times_X Y$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  In topology, the fiber functor is representable if $X$ is a connected and locally simply connected space. The representing object $\tilde{X}$ is called the universal covering. In algebraic geometry this functor is usually not representable. It is however pro-representable:
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Pro-representability]
  Let $C$ be a category and $F: C \to \Set$ a functor. We say that $F$ is \textit{pro-representable} if there exists an \Gls{inverse system} $(A_\alpha,\varphi_{\alpha \beta})$ in $C$ such that 
  \[
    \varinjlim \Hom(A_\alpha, X) \cong F(X)
    \]
  for each $X$ in $C$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  Let $f: Y \to X$ be a connected finite \'etale cover. There is a morphism $\varphi: S \to Y$ such that $f \circ \varphi: S \to X$ is a finite \'etale cover. Moreover every morphism over $X$ from a Galois cover to $Y$ factors through $\varphi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pro_rep}
  The fiber functor $F_{\overline{x}}$ is prorepresentable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of theorem \ref{thm:pro_rep}]
  We need to construct an inverse system in $Fet/X$ such that the above isomorphism holds. Take as index set $I$ all finite \'etale Galois covers $A_\alpha$ of $X$. This set is directed under the order $A_\alpha \le A_\beta$, since the connected components fiber product
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $X$ be a scheme and $\overline{x} : \Spec(\Omega) \to X$ a geometric point.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Galois covers]
  A connected finite \'etale cover $Y \to X$ is \textit{Galois} if its group of $X$-automorphism acts transitively on geometric fibers.
\end{definition}


\begin{remark}
  Recall that a category $\mathcal{C}$ is \textit{cofiltered} if the following holds:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For any pair of objects $a_1$ and $a_2$, there is an object $b$ with maps $b \to a_1$ and $b \to a_2$.
    \item Every pair of morphisms $f,g: a \to b$, there is an equalizer $h: c \to a$. This means that $f \circ h = g \circ h$.
  \end{enumerate} 
  Let $x$ be a point of $X$. The subcategory of $\Op(X)$ consisting of all sets containing $x$ is cofilterd. This means for two open sets $U$ and $V$, there is an open set contained in both of them, namely $U \cap V$. The second condition does not need to be verified, since there is at most one morphism between any two open sets.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[\'Etale neighborhoods]
  Let $X$ be a scheme and $x$ a point of $X$. An \'etale neighborhood of $x$ is defined to be a pair $(U, u)$ together with an \'etale morphism $\varphi: U \to X$ such that $\varphi(u) = x$. A morphism of \'etale neighborhoods $f: (V,v) \to (U,u)$ is a morphism of $X$-schemes $f: V \to U$ such that $f(v) = u$.
\end{definition}
We obtain the category of \'etale neigborhoods of $x$ for each $x \in X$.

\begin{definition}[Affine maps of schemes]
  Let $\varphi: X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes over a field $k$. We say $\varphi$ is an affine map if every open affine subscheme $U = \Spec(R) \subseteq Y$ has as preimage an affine open subscheme $f^{-1}(U) = \Spec(S)$ of $X$. If, in addition, the corresponding map $R \to S$ makes $S$ into a finitely generated $R$-module, we say that $\varphi$ is finite.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $k$ be a field. Then $X$ is finite \'etale over $\Spec(k)$ if and only f $X$ is isomorphic do a disjoint union $\amalg \Spec(K_i)$, where each $K_i$ is a finite separable extension of $k$

  Consider first the case that $X$ is connected. It follows that $X = \Spec(A)$ and that $A$ is a vector space of finite dimension over $k$. If $A$ is not a field then it has a

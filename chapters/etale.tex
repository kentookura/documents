The issues we encountered in the introduction all stem from the fact that the Zariski topology is too coarse to speak of ``local triviality''. Grothendieck found a natural generalisation of the notion of topology, allowing not only open subsets $U \subseteq X$ but more generally morphisms of schemes $Y \to X$ to play the role of open set. Specifically, he defined the \textit{\'etale site of $X$}, a generalised topology on $X$, consisting of the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The category of \'etale schemes $\text{\'Et}/X$ over $X$. Its objects are schemes $f:S \to X$ \'etale over $X$.
	\item A notion of covering. In this case a covering of $X$ is a family of \'etale morphisms $\{\varphi_i: U_i \to X\}$ such that they are jointly surjective, $\bigcup_i im(\varphi_i) = X$.
\end{itemize}

In this section we will define and study \'etale morphisms. Because \'etale morphisms behave like local homeomorphisms, they yield a good theory of covering spaces for schemes. In particular this means that we can define the notion of the \'etale fundamental groups $\pi_1^{\et}(X)$. The definition of a sheaf carries over seamlessly from the classical case of topological spaces to the case of sheaves on sites. A category of sheaves on a site is called a topos. The \'etale topos $\mathsf{Sh}_{\et}(X)$ of $X$ may be thought of as a generalised space, locally modeled on $X$, with a close relation to the geometric properties of $X$.
%Furthermore, the \'etale topos $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$ also allows us to compute cohomology for sheaves which have vanishing cohomology in the Zariski setting. In this sense the \'etale site of a scheme is a much finer topology than the Zariski topology.

\section{\'Etale Algebras}
We begin our discussion with the simple case of \'etale covers of $X = \Spec(k)$, where $k$ is a field. Recall that an extension $L/k$ is separable if its minimal polynomial $p(x)$ has no multiple roots (in a splitting field of $p(x)$). It follows from basic algebra that a polynomial $p(x)$ is separable if and only if it is coprime to its derivative $p'(x)$. This means that $p'(x)$ gets mapped to a unit under the canonical map $k[x] \to k[x]/(p(x)) \simeq L$. This is in effect a smoothness condition, reminiscent of the conditions under which the inverse mapping theorem from analysis holds. This idea will reappear when we define \'etale morphisms in a more general condition.

It is reasonable to demand that for $f: Y \to \Spec(k)$ to be a local homeomorphism, the underlying topological space of $Y$ should consist of a finite number of disjoint points, so $Y = \Spec(\prod L_i)$ where each $L_i$ is a field extension of $k$.

\begin{definition}[Finite \'etale algebras]
	A $k$-algebra $A$ is \'etale over $k$ if it is isomorphic to a product of separable extensions of $k$. If $A$ is finite dimensional over $k$ we say that $A$ is finite \'etale over $k$. We define $\Spec(A) \to \Spec(k)$ to be \'etale (resp. finite \'etale) if $A$ is a (finite) \'etale algebra over $k$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Reminder on Galois theory for finite \'etale algebras}
We recall the basics of Galois theory as Grothendieck formulated them.

\begin{construction}[Reminder on Galois theory]
	Let $k$ be a field and fix once and for all separable and algebraic closures $k_s \subset \overline{k}$ of $k$. An algebraic extension $L$ of $k$ is a \textit{Galois extension} if the elements of $L$ that are fixed under the automorphism group $\Aut_k(L)$ are precisely the elements of $k$.A separable extension $L/k$ is Galois if and only if the minimal polynomial of each element $a \in L$ splits into linear factors in $L$. If $L$ is Galois, we call $\Aut_k(L)$ the \textit{Galois group} of $L$ over $k$ and denote it by $\Gal(L/k)$. In particular $k_s$ is a Galois extension. We call its Galois group the \textit{absolute Galois group of $k$} and denote it by $\Gal(k)$. Let $L$ be a finite separable extension of $k$. The set $\Hom_k(L, k_s)$ is finite has cardinality $[L:k]$. This set is endowed with a left action of $\Gal(k_s/k)$ given by $\varphi \to g \circ \varphi$ for $g \in \Gal(k)$ and $\varphi \in \Hom_k(L, k_s)$. If $k_s$ is an infinte extension, $\Gal(k)$ is a profinite group and hence carries a totally disconnected topology. If $\Hom(L, k_s)$ is given the discrete topology, the action of $\Gal(k)$ is continuous if for each stabilizer
	\[G_x = \{ g \in G \mid g \circ \varphi = \varphi\ \forall\varphi \in \Hom_k(L, k_s)\}, \]
	which is easy to check.
\end{construction}

\begin{proposition}
	The action of $\Gal(k)$ on $\Hom_k(L, k_s)$ is continuous and transitive and $\Hom_k(L, k_s)$ is isomorphic as a left $\Gal(k)$-set to the $\Gal(k)$-set $\Gal(k)/U$ for some open subgroup $U \subseteq \Gal(k)$
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Main Theorem of Galois Theory, Grothendieck's version]\label{theorem:galois}
	Let $k$ be a field. The functor mapping a finite \'etale $k$-algebra $A$ to the finite set $\Hom_k(A, k_s)$ induces an equivalence of categories between the cateogry of \'etale $k$-algebras and the category of sets with a continous left $\text{Gal}(k)$-action
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	$A$ is isomorphic to a product of finite separable extension $\prod L_i$.Each element of the $\Gal(k)$-set $\coprod_i \Hom_k(L_i, k_s)$ has an open stabilizer by definition of the profinite topology on $\Gal(k)$. Conversely consider a $\Gal(k)$ set $T$ and write it as a disjoint union of orbits $\coprod T_i$. Pick an element $t_i \in T_i$ and let $G_i \subset \Gal(k)$ be its open stabilizer. Then the scheme
	\[
		\coprod_i \Spec(k_s^{G_i})
	\]
	is \'etale over $k$ because by Galois theory each $k_s^{G_i}$ is a finite separable extension of $k$. This gives an inverse to the functor.
\end{proof}

The following theorem is strongly reminiscent of the following theorem from algebraic topology:

\begin{theorem}
	Let $(X,x)$ be a pointed, connected and locally simply connected topological space. The fiber functor $\text{Fib}_x$ induces an equivalence of categories between the category of covers of $X$ with the category of left $\pi_1(X,x)$-sets.
\end{theorem}

See Chapter (...) for the definitions used in the statement.

Let $L/K$ be a finite field extension of degree $n$. Each element $a$ of $L$ induces a $K$-linear map
\[
	m_a: L \to L,\ b \to ab.
\]
Since $L \cong K^{\oplus n}$ as a $K$-module, we may choose a basis of $L$ over $K$ and represent the map $m_a$ as an $n \times n$ matrix with entries in $K$. We may take the trace and determinant of this matrix. But the trace and determinant are independent of the choice of the choice of basis, so
\[
	\Tr_{L/K}(a) = \Tr(\text{matrix of }m_a)
\]
and
\[
	\Norm_{L/K}(a) = \text{det}(\text{matrix of }m_a).
\]
are well defined.

\begin{definition}
	Let $L/K$ be a finite field extension. The \textit{trace pairing for $L/K$} is the symmetric $K$-bilinear form
	\[
		Q_{L/K} : L \times L \to K,\ (a,b) \to \Tr_{L/K}(ab)
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $L/K$ be a finite field extension. The following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $L/K$ is separable.
		\item $\Tr_{L/K}$ is not identically zero.
		\item $Q_{L/K}$ is nondegenerate.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The equivalence of (2.) and (3.) are clear.
	For the equivalence of (1.) and (2.) see (Keith Conrad, separability)
	%The trace map is $K$-linear with target $K$ so it is either identically 0 or surjective. We only have to consider the case where $K$ has characteristic $p \neq 0$, since finite extensions in characteristic 0 are always separable and $\Tr_{L/K}(1) = [L:K] \neq 0$ in characteristic 0.\par
	%Let $L/K$ be separable. By the primitive element theorem we can write $L = K(\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is separable over $K$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $A$ be a finite dimensional commutative $k$-algebra and denote by $\overline{A}$ the $\overline{k}$-algebra $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$. The following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $A$ is \'etale over $k$.\label{etale}
		\item $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$ is isomorphic to a finite product of copies of $\overline{k}$, hence \'etale over $\overline{k}$.\label{product}
		\item $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$ is reduced
		\item The discriminant of any basis of $A$ over $k$ is nonzero.\label{trace}
		      %The trace pairing $A \times A \to k, (x,y) \to \text{Tr}(xy)$ is nondegenerate.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	(\Implies{etale}{product}):
	Suppose that $L$ is a finite separable extension of $k$. This means that $L = k[x]/(f)$, where $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ which splits into $n$ distinct factors, say $(x-\alpha_i)$ in $\overline{k}$. By the chinese remainder theorem we have
	\[L \otimes_k \overline{k} \cong \overline{k}[x]/(f) = \overline{k}[x]/(x-\alpha_1)\cdots(x-\alpha_n) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n \overline{k}[x] / (x-\alpha_i) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n \overline{k},\] from which the first direction follows.\\
	(\Implies{etale}{trace}):
	If $A = \prod k_i$  where each $k_i$ is a separable field extension of $k$, then $\text{disc}(A) = \prod \text{disc}(k_i)$ which is nonzero by the fact that $\text{disc}(k_i) \neq 0$ if $k_i$ is a separable extension.
	%TODO finish the proof
\end{proof}

We generalise the notion of \'etale algebra to algebras over a ring.

\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be a ring, $A$ a free $R$-algebra of finite rank. As before, every $a \in A$ defines an $R$-linear map by multiplication and the trace map $A \to R$ is well defined. We say that $A$ is a \textit{separable} or \textit{\'etale} algebra if the $R$-bilinear mapping
	\[
		Q : A \times A \to R,\ (a,b) \to \Tr(ab)
	\]
	is nondegenerate.
\end{definition}

\section{\'Etale morphisms of schemes}
\begin{definition}
	A morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ is called \textit{affine} if there is an open affine cover by subsets $U_i$ such that $f^{-1}(U_i)$ is affine for each $i$. A morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ is called \textit{finite} if there is an affine cover by subsets $U_i = \Spec(A)$ such that $f^{-1}(U_i) = \Spec(B_i)$ is a finitely generated $A_i$-module. If moreover each $B_i$ is a free separable $A_i$-algebra, it is said to be \'etale.
\end{definition}
It follows that $f: \Spec(B) \to \Spec(A)$ is an \'etale morphism if and only if $B$ is an \'etale $A$-algebra.

\begin{definition}\label{def:flatness}
	A ring homomorphism $f: A \to B$ is flat if the functor $- \otimes_A B$ is exact. A morphism $f: Y \to X$ of schemes is flat if for all afffine subsets $U \subset Y$ and $V \subset X$ with $f(V) \subset U$, the map $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X) \to \Gamma(V, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ is flat.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Examples of flat maps}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open immersions are flat
	\item The composite of flat morphisms is flat
	\item Any base extension a flat morphism is flat
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module. The following are equivalent:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $M$ is flat.
		\item $M_m$ is a free $A_m$-module for all maximal ideals $m$ of $A$.
		\item $\widetilde{M}$ is a locally free sheaf on $\Spec(A)$.
		\item $M$ is projective as an $A$-module.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

We recall some basic facts about flat maps and
\begin{lemma}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The composition of affine morphisms is affine.
		\item The composition of finite locally free morphisms is finite locally free.
		\item The composition of \'etale morphisms is \'etale.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The first statement follows immediately from the fact that a morphism $f: X \to Y$ is affine if and only if for \textit{every} affine open $V \subseteq X$, $f^{-1}(V)$ is affine, see\cite{Hartshorne}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	If $f: Y \to X$ is \'etale, then the base change $U \times_X Y$ along any morphism $U \to X$ is \'etale.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	A surjective finite \'etale morphism is called an \'etale cover. An \'etale cover $\varphi : Y \to X$ is called trivial if $Y$ is isomorphic do a finite disjoint union of copies of $X$ $Y \cong \coprod X$ and $\varphi$ restricts to the identity on each component.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{locallyTrivial}
	Let $X$ be a connected scheme and $\varphi : Y \to X$ an affine surjective morphism. Then $\varphi$ is finite \'etale if and only if there is a finite, locally free and surjective morphism $f: S \to X$ such that $Y \times_X S$ is a trivial cover of $S$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	$(\implies)$
	We first show that $\varphi$ is finite and locally free. Since $f$ is locally free, each point of $X$ has an affine open neighborhood $U = \Spec(R)$ such that $f$ restricts to a morphism $\Spec(A) \to \Spec(R)$ where $A$ is a finitely generated and free $R$-module. Since $\varphi$ is affine, it restricts to $\Spec(B) \to \Spec(R)$ over $U$ for some $R$-algebra $B$. The basechange $S \times_X Y$ restricts to $\Spec(A \otimes_R B)$ over $\Spec(R)$ and we have the following commutative diagrams:

	By assumption $A \otimes_R B$ is a finitely generated and free $A$-module, so it is also fnitely generated and free as an $R$-module. It is also isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of $A$. This can only happen if $B$ is finitely generated and free over $R$. \par

	Now let $\overline{x} : \Spec(\overline{k}) \to S$ be a geometric point of $S$. By composition with $f$ we get a geometric point of $X$. Now the geometric fibers $Y_{(f \circ \overline{x})}$ and $(S \times_X Y)_{\overline{x}}$  are isomorphic by the universal property of pullbacks.

	\]
	By assumption, $(S\times_X Y)_{\overline{x}} \cong \prod \Spec(\overline{k})$ and since $f$ is surjective, all of the fibers of $\varphi$ are also \'etale.
\end{proof}
Theorem \ref{locallyTrivial} shows that \'etale morphsism are locally trivial in the \'etale topology.

\begin{remark}
	If we have an \'etale cover $f: Y \to X$ and consider a geometric point $\overline{x} : \Spec(\Omega) \to X$ of $X$, then the fiber of $f$ over $\overline{x}$ arises from the pullback

	Since $\Spec(\Omega)\times_X Y$ is \'etale over $\Spec(\Omega)$ and $\Omega$ is algebraically closed, it follows that $\Spec(\Omega)\times_X Y \cong \coprod \Spec(\Omega)$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Galois theory for \'etale covers}
\begin{definition}[The fiber functor $F_x$]
	Let $x: \Spec(\Omega) \to X$ be a geometric point, where $\Omega$ is an algebraically field. The fiber functor at $x$ associates to each \'etale cover $f: Y \to X$ the underlying set of $\Spec(\Omega) \times_X Y$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	In topology, the fiber functor is representable if $X$ is a connected and locally simply connected space. The representing object $\tilde{X}$ is called the universal covering. In algebraic geometry this functor is usually not representable. It is however pro-representable:
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Pro-representability]
	Let $C$ be a category and $F: C \to \Set$ a functor. We say that $F$ is \textit{pro-representable} if there exists an \Gls{inverse system} $(A_\alpha,\varphi_{\alpha \beta})$ in $C$ such that
	\[
		\varinjlim \Hom(A_\alpha, X) \cong F(X)
	\]
	for each $X$ in $C$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $f: Y \to X$ be a connected finite \'etale cover. There is a morphism $\varphi: S \to Y$ such that $f \circ \varphi: S \to X$ is a finite \'etale cover. Moreover every morphism over $X$ from a Galois cover to $Y$ factors through $\varphi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pro_rep}
	The fiber functor $F_{\overline{x}}$ is prorepresentable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of theorem \ref{thm:pro_rep}]
	We need to construct an inverse system in $Fet/X$ such that the above isomorphism holds. Take as index set $I$ all finite \'etale Galois covers $A_\alpha$ of $X$. This set is directed under the order $A_\alpha \le A_\beta$, since the connected components fiber product
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $X$ be a scheme and $\overline{x} : \Spec(\Omega) \to X$ a geometric point.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Galois covers]
	A connected finite \'etale cover $Y \to X$ is \textit{Galois} if its group of $X$-automorphism acts transitively on geometric fibers.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Affine maps of schemes]
	Let $\varphi: X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes over a field $k$. We say $\varphi$ is an affine map if every open affine subscheme $U = \Spec(R) \subseteq Y$ has as preimage an affine open subscheme $f^{-1}(U) = \Spec(S)$ of $X$. If, in addition, the corresponding map $R \to S$ makes $S$ into a finitely generated $R$-module, we say that $\varphi$ is finite.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $k$ be a field. Then $X$ is finite \'etale over $\Spec(k)$ if and only f $X$ is isomorphic to a disjoint union $\amalg \Spec(K_i)$, where each $K_i$ is a finite separable extension of $k$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider first the case that $X$ is connected. It follows that $X = \Spec(A)$ and that $A$ is a vector space of finite dimension over $k$. If $A$ is not a field then it has a
\end{proof}



\begin{definition}[Faithfully flat morphisms]
	An $R$-module $M$ is \textit{flat} if the functor $N \to M \otimes_R M$ is exact. In other words: tensoring with $M$ preserves exact sequences. If the functor is also faithful, we say that $M$ is \textit{faithfully flat} over $R$.

\section*{Acknowledgement}
I am deeply indebted to my supervisor Ivan Di Liberti for his guidance and advice in navigating the vast literature on topos theory, and for granting me the freedom to explore these topics on my own. I learnt so much more over the course of the semester than I was able to put into writing. I am also thankful to all my friends and colleagues at university for their companionship and willingness to listen to me ramble on about mathematics that I did not yet fully understand. Finally I would like to thank Magda Hochsteiner for her hospitality, allowing me to stay in her beautiful home in the countryside, where I spent the last week before the due date writing this thesis.
